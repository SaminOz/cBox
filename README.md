Shift-Click checkboxes 

Script that will take a class and allow shift clicking on checkbox inputs identified by that class. 

Usage: 
Use when you want to give the user the facility to identify certain items via checkboxes (much like the issues list on github) for further processing.

By giving each of the inputs the same class (or other CSS Selector) the script will enable shift clicking.
